## Abstract
Zoonotic mosquito-borne viruses, including West Nile, Rift Valley fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses, present a substantial public health burden in some countries, with transmission involving complex interactions between multiple vector and host species. While host community composition is known to affect transmission, the role of spatial heterogeneity in host distribution and mosquito aggregation behaviour remains poorly understood, despite evidence that these factors vary substantially in real-world settings. 

We developed a spatially explicit, patch-based transmission model that integrates mosquito host-seeking across two scales: long-range aggregation toward host-dense patches and short-range host species choice determined by local host availability and innate vector preference. Using this model, we explored the potential effect of host clustering, patch fragmentation, and the strength of mosquito aggregation on the basic reproduction number and epidemic dynamics of zoonotic mosquito-borne viruses.

Our results show that identical host communities can yield very different transmission outcomes depending on their spatial configuration and mosquito aggregation. If competent hosts are clustered and mosquitoes aggregate strongly, transmission may be amplified compared with uniformly distributed hosts and vectors. The opposite is true if dead-end hosts are clustered. Fragmentation effects are context-dependent: under moderate aggregation, increasing patch number generally increases transmission, while under strong or absent aggregation, the effect reverses depending on which host type is clustered.

These findings highlight that variations in the local spatial context of host-vector interactions can lead to variations in disease risk. Locally-informed surveillance and targeted interventions may therefore be important for the effective control of zoonotic mosquito-borne viruses.
